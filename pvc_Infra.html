      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Rigid PVC (uPVC):</h2>
      <p>
        This type is strong, stiff, and used for applications like pipes, fittings, and window frames.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Flexible PVC (PVC-P):</h2>
      <p>
        This type is more pliable and used in products like inflatable structures, hoses, and electrical cable insulation.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Chlorinated PVC (CPVC):</h2>
      <p>
        CPVC has enhanced heat resistance and is often used for hot water pipes and industrial applications.
      </p>

    </article>

    <article class="box box1">
      <h4> About Lighting & Electrical Fitting</h4>
      <p>
        Lighting and electrical fittings are crucial components of any building, be it residential, commercial, or
        industrial. They encompass a wide range of fixtures, devices, and systems that are designed to provide
        illumination and electrical connectivity. Here's some information about lighting and electrical fitting:
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="box box2">
      <h3>1. Types of Lighting Fixtures:</h3><br>

      <h2>General Lighting:</h2>
      <p>
        These fixtures provide overall illumination to a room or space. Examples include ceiling-mounted fixtures,
        chandeliers, and recessed lights.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Task Lighting:</h2>
      <p>
        Task-oriented fixtures are used to illuminate specific areas where activities like reading, cooking, or working
        are performed. Desk lamps, under-cabinet lighting, and pendant lights are common examples.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Accent Lighting:</h2>
      <p>
        Accent lights are used to highlight specific architectural features, artworks, or decorative elements. Track
        lighting and wall-mounted spotlights are commonly used for accent lighting.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Decorative Lighting:</h2>
      <p>
        These fixtures are primarily chosen for their aesthetic appeal. Examples include ornate chandeliers, pendant
        lights, and decorative wall sconces.
      </p>

    </article>

    <article class="box box3">
      <h3>2. Types of Bulbs and Light Sources:</h3><br>

      <h2>Incandescent Bulbs:</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional bulbs that produce light by heating a wire filament until it emits visible light. They are less
        energy-efficient compared to other options.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs):</h2>
      <p>
        Energy-efficient bulbs that use a gas to produce ultraviolet light, which then stimulates a phosphorescent
        coating to emit visible light.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>LED (Light Emitting Diode) Bulbs:</h2>
      <p>
        Highly energy-efficient and long-lasting bulbs that produce light by passing an electrical current through a
        semiconductor.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Halogen Bulbs:</h2>
      <p>
        A type of incandescent bulb that contains a halogen gas, resulting in a brighter and whiter light compared to
        traditional incandescents.
      </p>

    </article>

    <article class="box box4">
      <h3>3. Electrical Fittings:</h3><br>

      <h2>Switches and Sockets:</h2>
      <p>
        These are essential for controlling electrical devices and connecting appliances to the electrical supply.
        Modern designs offer various styles and features.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Circuit Breakers:</h2>
      <p>
        Circuit breakers protect electrical circuits from overloads or faults by interrupting the electrical flow. They
        are crucial for safety.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Wiring and Conduits:</h2>
      <p>
        Wiring connects all electrical components, and conduits protect the wires from damage. Proper wiring and conduit
        installation are essential for safety and functionality.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Distribution Boards (Fuse Boxes):</h2>
      <p>
        These panels distribute electrical power throughout a building, with individual circuits connected to circuit
        breakers or fuses.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Light Switch Dimmers:</h2>
      <p>
        Dimmer switches allow users to adjust the brightness of the lighting, offering flexibility and energy savings.
      </p>

    </article>

    <article class="box box5">
      <h3>4. Safety and Regulations:</h3><br>
      <p>
        Proper installation of lighting and electrical fittings is critical for safety. It should be performed by
        qualified electricians who adhere to local electrical codes and regulations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regular maintenance and inspections are essential to ensure the safety and functionality of electrical systems.
      </p>

    </article>

    <article class="box box6">
      <h3>5. Energy Efficiency:</h3><br>
      <p>
        Energy-efficient lighting and electrical fittings, such as LED bulbs and smart switches, can help reduce
        electricity consumption and lower utility bills.
      </p>

    </article>

    <article class="box7">
      <h3>6. Smart Lighting and Automation:</h3><br>
      <p>
        Smart lighting systems allow users to control lighting remotely, set schedules, and adjust brightness. These
        systems enhance convenience and energy efficiency.
      </p>

      <p>
        Automation features can include motion sensors, light sensors, and integration with smart home platforms for
        enhanced control.
      </p>

    </article>

    <article class="box8">
      <p>
        Lighting and electrical fittings play a significant role in the functionality, safety, and aesthetics of a
        building. Choosing the right fixtures and ensuring proper installation are essential steps in creating a
        well-lit and efficient living or working space.

    <article class="box box2">
      <h3>1. Processes in Fabrication:</h3><br>

      <h2>Cutting:</h2>
      <p>
        Cutting is the initial step in fabrication, involving the removal of excess material from a workpiece. Common cutting methods include sawing, shearing, laser cutting, and plasma cutting.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Bending:</h2>
      <p>
        Bending involves shaping the material by applying force to it, typically using press brakes or specialized bending machines.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Welding:</h2>
      <p>
        Welding joins metal parts by melting them together and allowing them to cool, creating a strong and permanent bond. Common welding methods include arc welding, MIG (Metal Inert Gas) welding, and TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welding.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Machining:</h2>
      <p>
        Machining processes, such as milling, drilling, and turning, are used to remove material and create precise shapes and dimensions.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Assembly:</h2>
      <p>
        Fabrication often involves assembling multiple components into a final product. This can include fastening, riveting, or adhesive bonding.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Finishing:</h2>
      <p>
        Surface finishing processes like grinding, polishing, and painting improve the aesthetics and functionality of fabricated products.
      </p>

      <h2>Construction:</h2>
      <p>
        In the construction industry, structural steel fabrication plays a vital role in creating buildings, bridges, and infrastructure.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Aerospace:</h2>
      <p>
        Precision fabrication is essential in the aerospace sector for manufacturing aircraft components and assemblies.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Automotive:</h2>
      <p>
        Automotive fabrication involves creating vehicle frames, chassis, body panels, and other components.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Shipbuilding:</h2>
      <p>
        Fabrication is crucial in building ships and offshore structures.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Electronics:</h2>
      <p>
        The fabrication of custom enclosures, brackets, and housings is common in the electronics industry.
      </p>

    <article class="box box4">
      <h3>3. Materials Used:</h3><br>
      <p>
        Fabrication works can involve various materials, including metals (steel, aluminum, copper, etc.), plastics, composites, glass, and even wood in certain cases.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>4. Customization:</h3>
      <p>
        Fabrication allows for high levels of customization. Parts and products can be tailored to meet specific design, size, and performance requirements.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>5. Precision and Quality:</h3>
      <p>
        Fabrication demands precision and quality control to ensure that components meet design specifications and safety standards.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>6. Technology Advancements:</h3>
      <p>
        Advancements in technology, such as computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), have revolutionized fabrication by enabling precise design, simulation, and automation of processes.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>7. Sustainability:</h3>
      <p>
        Sustainable practices in fabrication include recycling and minimizing waste through efficient material utilization.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>8. Safety:</h3>
      <p>
        Safety is a top priority in fabrication works. Proper training, equipment, and safety protocols are essential to protect workers and ensure the quality of the finished products.
      </p>

    <article class="box box1">
      <h4> About Solar Energy</h4>
      <p>
        Solar energy, often referred to as solar power, is a renewable and sustainable source of electricity generated from the sun's radiant energy. It is harnessed using various technologies, primarily photovoltaic (PV) cells and solar thermal systems, and has become an increasingly important part of the global energy landscape. Here's some information about solar energy:
      </p>
    </article>

    <article class="box box2">
      <h3>1. How Solar Energy Works:</h3><br>

      <h2>Photovoltaic (PV) Cells:</h2>
      <p>
        Solar panels, also known as PV panels or modules, consist of multiple PV cells made of semiconductor materials, typically silicon. When sunlight (photons) hits these cells, it excites electrons, generating a flow of electricity known as direct current (DC).
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Solar Inverters:</h2>
      <p>
        The DC electricity generated by solar panels is then converted into alternating current (AC) electricity by solar inverters. AC electricity is the form of electricity used in homes and businesses.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Energy Storage (Optional):</h2>
      <p>
        Excess electricity generated during the day can be stored in batteries for use during nighttime or cloudy periods.
      </p>
      <!-- <br>
      <h2>Fishing Nets:</h2>
      <p>
        Fishing nets are essential tools for the fishing industry. They come in various sizes and designs, depending on the type of fishing and the targeted species.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Avian Netting:</h2>
      <p>
        Avian netting is used to prevent birds from entering specific areas, such as airports, farms, and buildings, where they can cause damage or pose safety hazards.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Garden and Landscaping Netting:</h2>
      <p>
        Netting solutions are used in gardening and landscaping to support plants, create trellises, and protect vegetation from animals.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Debris Netting:</h2>
      <p>
        Debris netting is commonly used in construction to contain falling debris, improving safety and preventing damage to adjacent structures.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Insect Netting:</h2>
      <p>
        Insect nets are used in agriculture and horticulture to protect crops from insects and pests while allowing air and light to pass through.
      </p> -->

    <article class="box box3">
      <h3>2. Advantages of Solar Energy:</h3><br>

      <h2>Renewable:</h2>
      <p>
        Solar energy is an abundant and inexhaustible energy source as long as the sun continues to shine, which is expected for billions of years.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Clean and Sustainable:</h2>
      <p>
        Solar power generation produces no greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants, making it an environmentally friendly energy source.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Reduced Electricity Bills:</h2>
      <p>
        Solar panels can significantly reduce or even eliminate electricity bills, providing long-term cost savings for homeowners and businesses.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Energy Independence:</h2>
      <p>
        Solar energy systems reduce reliance on grid electricity and help secure a more stable and localized energy supply.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Low Operating and Maintenance Costs:</h2>
      <p>
        Solar panels have minimal operating and maintenance costs, primarily involving occasional cleaning and inverter maintenance.
      </p>
    

    </article>

    <article class="box box5">
      <h3>3. Solar Applications:</h3><br>

      <h2>Residential Solar:</h2>
      <p>
        Homeowners can install rooftop solar panels to generate electricity for their homes. Excess energy can be fed back into the grid, earning credits or income.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Commercial and Industrial Solar:</h2>
      <p>
        Businesses and industries can use solar power to reduce operating costs and demonstrate environmental responsibility.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Utility-Scale Solar:</h2>
      <p>
        Large solar farms generate significant amounts of electricity for communities or regions. These installations are often connected to the grid.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Off-Grid Solar:</h2>
      <p>
        Solar power can be used in remote areas where grid electricity is unavailable, providing a reliable source of electricity for homes, schools, and healthcare facilities.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Solar Water Heating:</h2>
      <p>
        Solar thermal systems are used to heat water for domestic or industrial purposes, reducing the need for conventional water heaters.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Solar Cooking:</h2>
      <p>
        Solar cookers and ovens use sunlight to cook food, particularly in regions with limited access to traditional fuel sources.
      </p>

    </article>

    <!-- <article class="box box6">
      <h3>5. Energy Efficiency:</h3><br>
      <p>
        Energy-efficient lighting and electrical fittings, such as LED bulbs and smart switches, can help reduce
        electricity consumption and lower utility bills.
      </p>

    </article>

    <article class="box7">
      <h3>6. Smart Lighting and Automation:</h3><br>
      <p>
        Smart lighting systems allow users to control lighting remotely, set schedules, and adjust brightness. These
        systems enhance convenience and energy efficiency.
      </p>

      <p>
        Automation features can include motion sensors, light sensors, and integration with smart home platforms for
        enhanced control.
      </p>
